# DRTiD

We propose a new benchmark dataset, namely Diabetic Retinopathy Two-field image Dataset (DRTiD), consisting of 3,100 two-field fundus images. Two-field images contains a pair of macula-centric and optic disc-centric images. We provide annotations of DR severity grades and localization of macula & optic disc.
